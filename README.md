# Comparative Analysis of Integration Results

## Results of Calculations

1. Integral using Monte Carlo method: 2.675
2. Integral using quad function: 2.6666666666666665

## Conclusions

The Monte Carlo method provided a reasonably close result to the integral value obtained using the quad function from the SciPy library. The difference between the two values is small, indicating the correctness of both methods. The Monte Carlo method is straightforward to implement and can handle complex functions where analytical methods may not be applicable.
